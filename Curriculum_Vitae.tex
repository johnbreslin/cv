According to Google Scholar Citations, my h-index is \textbf{50} and I have over \textbf{10,000} citations. My ORCID is 0000-0001-5790-050X.

My top cited publications (with over 300 citations) are: ``Crowdsourcing, Citizen Sensing and Sensor Web Technologies for Public and Environmental Health Surveillance and Crisis Management'' (cited by 532); ``Optimizing the AC Resistance of Multilayer Transformer Windings with Arbitrary Current Waveforms'' (cited by 427); ``Towards Semantically Interlinked Online Communities'' (cited by 354); ``The Social Semantic Web'' (cited by 350); ``The Future of Social Networks on the Internet: The Need for Semantics'' (cited by 349); and ``Optimized Transformer Design: Inclusive of High Frequency Effects'' (cited by 313).

I have collaborated with about \textbf{200} other authors (see graph on right), including academic, government and industrial co-authors in organisations such as Cisco, Harvard Medical School, IBM, the US Government's Department of Health and Human Services.

My publications have been cited in patents granted to Cisco, Google, IBM, Offerpop and SAP, and patent applications by HP and Siemens, amongst others.

``Old Ireland in Colour'' co-authored with Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley is a bestselling book that brings Irish historical black and white photographs to life using a combination of artificial intelligence and human colourisation, and sold 50,000 copies in Ireland during 2020 (over \euro{}1,000,000 in sales). The sequel ``Old Ireland in Colour 2'' was also an Irish bestseller in 2021. Combined, both books have sold over 125,000 copies.

``The Social Semantic Web'' is a recommended course book in modules at Anna University Chennai, Bo\u{g}azi\c{c}i University, Institute of Technology Tallaght, National Institute of Technology Patna, Technical University of Munich, University of Bamberg, University of Vigo, Utrecht Graduate School of Humanities. It has been downloaded over 10,000 times. Two independent reviews are given below:

\medskip
\begin{quotation}``The book focuses mainly on the social Web and possibilities of its integration with the semantic Web. ... For Web developers, researchers, and graduate students, this book would be an ideal source for becoming acquainted with the evolving field of social applications on the Web. It may well fit into a seminar in information systems or related graduate study programs'' (M\'{a}ria Bielikov\'{a}, ACM Computing Reviews, September 2010)\end{quotation}

\medskip
\begin{quotation}``This book provides an easy-to-understand insight into Semantic Web and Social Web technologies and highlights research challenges when applying these technologies. ... each chapter provides a literature survey which provides an introduction state-of-the-art research from the domain. ... can be of interest for those, who consider using any of these Social Web applications in their research as well as those just want to get a solid foundation on the topic. ... IT professionals, researchers, academics and graduate students can all benefit from reading this book.'' (Frank Hopfgartner, Informer, January 2012)\end{quotation}
